In this project, we ready to make a smart car based on Thermal-EX, a character from game Arknights. He's a enthusiastic robot, ready to help you anywhere and anytime. We want to use this way for building the connection with the fan groups of this game, makeing fun for them who are love this game deeply.   

**TODO function**

LED blinking interval will be changed with the distance of ultrasonic ranging.

Add servo motor to rotate the head.

Add microphone and speaker for better interaction.

Add camera for face recognition.

## üìú How to use

```cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j
```
Here are two main functions now.  

**./LED_light**: It will print the logo of Arknights and Thermal-EX and say hi to you, then the LED light will start to blink slowly. The blinking interval can be changed through keyboard input.
