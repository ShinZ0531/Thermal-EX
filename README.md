In this project, we ready to make a smart car based on Thermal-EX, a character from game Arknights. He's a enthusiastic robot, ready to help you anywhere and anytime. We want to use this way for building the connection with the fan groups of this game, makeing fun for them who are love this game deeply.   
It is a basic prototype. We plan to add more functions in the furture.
